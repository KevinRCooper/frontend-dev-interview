## Tasks

This interview consists of four tasks, each of which is designed to test your skills in a different area of frontend development. Each task is intentionally open-ended in order to give room for you to showcase your natural instincts for how things should work when building a piece of user-facing UI. Feel free to google search, import libraries, or use any other tools that you would normally use during development.

1. TypeScript: Add the missing type definition for `RhombusDevice` in `src/assets/devices.ts`
2. HTML + CSS: Fill in the blanks in `App.tsx` to render a row or grid of device cards
3. JavaScript: Add basic search filtering to the device list using the provided `SearchInput` component
4. Debug: Find and fix the error in `SearchInput.tsx`. Bonus: What is going on in the internals of `SearchInput` and what real-life scenario would you use something like this in?
