## Tasks

This interview consists of four tasks, each of which is designed to test your skills in a different area of frontend development. Each task is intentionally open-ended in order to give room for you to showcase your natural instincts for how things should work when building a piece of user-facing UI. Feel free to google search, import libraries, or use any other tools that you would normally use during development.

1. Add the missing type definition for `RhombusDevice` in `src/assets/devices.ts`
2. Fill in the blanks in `App.tsx` to render a layout of device cards
3. Build a form that calls `src/state/registerDevice.ts` API to add a new device to the list
